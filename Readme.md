# ML Project: Network Intrusion Detection

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for network intrusion detection. The goal is to accurately classify network traffic as either normal or malicious, helping to identify potential security threats and protect the network from unauthorized access.

## Dataset
The project will utilize a publicly available dataset containing network traffic data. The dataset includes various features such as source and destination IP addresses, protocol type, service, and more. It is labeled with the corresponding network intrusion type, allowing for supervised learning.

## Methodology
The project will follow a typical machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. Various classification algorithms will be explored, such as decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines, to identify the most effective model for network intrusion detection.

## Evaluation
The performance of the developed model will be evaluated using standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation and confusion matrix analysis will be employed to assess the model's robustness and generalization capabilities.

## Conclusion
By successfully developing an accurate network intrusion detection model, this project aims to enhance network security and protect against potential cyber threats. The insights gained from this project can be applied to real-world scenarios, helping organizations safeguard their networks and sensitive data.
